# Linear Regression with NumPy and Python 

## Learning Objectives :

- Implementing the gradient descent algorithm from scratch.
- Perform univariate Linear Regression with NumPy and Python.
- Create Data visualizations and plots using matplotlib.

By the end of this course, I was able to build linear regression models from scratch using NumPy and Python, without the use of machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn and statsmodels.
